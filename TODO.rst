* fix aiming for microscope
* fix extrinsic aberrations
* fix >180 fov
* implement afocal infinte last conjugate
* optimization +example (pickups, solves, asa, limits, variables)
* tolerancing +example (mc, inverse sensitivity)
* analyze mtf through focus plot
* analyze mtf at values vs image height

* speedup refract, intercept, propagate
* aiming cache

* 3d plot
* better lens and glass catalogs: smaller, extensible
