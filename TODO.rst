* check material=None is the same as preceding
* fix paraxial race to be both axes
* alternate solution for intersect in spheroid (paraboloidal
  hyperhemispherical mirrors)

# finite/infinite focal/afocal object/image
  * implement afocal infinte last conjugate
# regular/telecentric pupils
# hyperhemispheric objects, fix >180 fov
# hyperhemispheric pupils

* fix aiming for microscope
* fix extrinsic aberrations
* optimization +example (pickups, solves, asa, limits, variables)
* tolerancing +example (mc, inverse sensitivity)
* analyze mtf through focus plot
* analyze mtf at values vs image height

* speedup refract, intercept, propagate
* aiming cache

* 3d plot
* better lens and glass catalogs: smaller, extensible
