RayOpt
========

Introduction
------------

Optics design (lenses, cavities, gaussian optics, lasers).
Geometric, paraxial, and gaussian ray tracing.


Installation
------------

Install like any usual Python package using `pip`, `easy_install`, or plain
`setup.py`.
The materials and lenses catalogs can be obtained from the freely available
versions of Oslo and Zemax, copied to `catalog/` and then parsed using
`rayopt/library.py` (see there for details on where the files are expected).
